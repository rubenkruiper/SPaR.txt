      ], "This document gives guidance on how to comply with these regulations.", "This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# and the other non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#. These Technical Handbooks have been issued by Scottish Ministers for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance with Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has eight sections. Section 0, this section, is identical in both Handbooks. It covers general issues and sets out how and when the regulations apply to #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and #DEFINED#works#TERM#.", "From the 2013 edition onwards, the Handbooks are published electronically and are available free on the Scottish Government, Building Standards Division website.", "Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the regulations, and there are different sets for #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# and non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#.

This is followed be each standard which has specific introductory information and guidance on how to comply with the standard. At the of the Handbook, after Section 7, there are the following two sections:", "Appendix A: Defined terms.", "Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.", "The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, published separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures Regulations 2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Crown #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# has also been produced."],
      "0.1.2 The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004": ["This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in the Building (Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found in schedule 5 to regulation 9, and are in the form of `expanded functional standards'. That is, the standards describe the functions a #DEFINED#building#TERM# should perform, such as `providing resistance to the spread of fire'.", "The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the regulations, so far as it relates to technical specifications, is also scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC checks with all the other countries that have adopted the #DEFINED#Construction Products Regulations#TERM# (CPR) to ensure that no barriers to trade in #DEFINED#construction#TERM# products are created, either directly or indirectly by the way products are described.", "To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and #DEFINED#construction#TERM# methods must be described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these exist. As there is a rolling programme of change to these National and European Standards, which includes conversion to, and the further provision of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks have been designed to be readily updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of specific European and British standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section concerned. There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks provided in Appendix B.", "The arrangement of Sections 1 - 7 within the Handbooks relates directly to the Basic Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which #DEFINED#construction#TERM##DEFINED#works#TERM# are expected to satisfy when they have been properly designed and #DEFINED#built#TERM#. The arrangement is as follows:", "Section 1 Structure (EC - Mechanical resistance and stability)", "Section 2 Fire (EC - Safety in case of fire)", "Section 3 Environment (EC - Hygiene, health and the environment)", "Section 4 Safety (EC - Safety and accessibility in use)", "Section 5 Noise (EC - Protection against noise)", "Section 6 Energy (EC - Energy, economy and heat retention)", "Section 7 Sustainability (EC - Sustainable use of natural resources)"],
      "0.1.3 The building standards system": ["The building regulations are enforced through the building standards system that is established by the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act sets out the enabling powers that allow Scottish Ministers to make, not only the building regulations, but also procedural regulations, fees regulations and the other supporting legislation needed to operate the system. The system is designed to ensure that new #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and #DEFINED#works#TERM# achieve the objectives of #DEFINED#the Act#TERM# in terms of health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel and power, and sustainable development.", "The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained in detail in the guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty to comply with the building regulations lies with the owner, or in some cases the client, for the #DEFINED#work#TERM#. Before #DEFINED#work#TERM# begins a building warrant must be obtained.", "For some simpler #DEFINED#works#TERM# a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but the regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply. The role of issuing warrants and accepting completion certificates rests with verifiers, enforcement is by local authorities, and the system is overseen and updated by the Building Standards Division (BSD). BSD forms part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is responsible to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance to the procedural regulations.", "The building standards system is pre-emptive, ensuring so far as possible that the proposed #DEFINED#works#TERM# will comply with the regulations. It recognises that proposals can change during #DEFINED#construction#TERM#, so there are requirements for amendments to the proposals to be agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must certify that the #DEFINED#works#TERM# have been #DEFINED#constructed#TERM# in accordance with the building warrant and the building regulations. The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure the completion certificate is accurate before accepting the certificate. Usually an inspection of the #DEFINED#works#TERM# will be made, and on most projects some inspection of #DEFINED#work#TERM# in progress will also have been carried out. However verifiers cannot inspect all materials and #DEFINED#work#TERM# on every #DEFINED#building site#TERM#. It is the client that should put in place the contractual and practical arrangements needed to assure themselves that the desired quality of #DEFINED#work#TERM# has been achieved."],
      "0.1.4 Status of Technical Handbooks": ["The regulations are mandatory, but the choice of how to comply lies with the #DEFINED#building#TERM# owner. This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the Building Standards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in full then this should be accepted by the verifier as indicating that the building regulations have been complied with. However it is quite acceptable to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the regulations.", "Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person liable to civil or criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the guidance may be relied on in any proceedings as tending to negative liability for an alleged contravention of the building regulations.", "Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be the normal way of complying with the building regulations. However, a designer may put forward other ways of meeting the regulations, in the form of alternative solutions.", "There are a further three guidance documents that have the same standing as the Technical Handbooks. Scottish Ministers have issued these under Section 4(1) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. These are:", [
        ["#Li1_1#\nGuide for practitioners 7: Fire Safety Management in Traditional Buildings, published by Historic Scotland, and\n", "#Li1_2#\nThe Scottish Building Standards - Technical handbook - Conservatories published by the Building Standards Division.\n"]
      ], "In due course other documents may be issued by Scottish Ministers to provide further guidance. Such guidance might deal with specific #DEFINED#building#TERM# types, or provide alternative methods of showing compliance with those provided in the Technical Handbooks."],
      "0.1.5 Alternative solutions": ["The use of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance, provides a flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative solutions is assisted by the expansion of the functional standards previously used in the building standards regulations to clarify the necessary properties of each #DEFINED#building#TERM#. The need for a formal relaxation of standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given solutions is no longer mandatory. The professional judgement of the verifier, assisted by guidance on questions referred to Scottish Ministers, through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is met.", "In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have regard to the details of this guidance. Where performance standards or policy statements are given, every part of the solution is expected to meet them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear suitable may not be acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in relation to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the `Approved Documents' (ADs), are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended are not the same. Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of fire size and the design of #DEFINED#compartmentation#TERM# which means that #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# meeting the AD on fire safety may not be acceptable. This will vary in time as both ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks are updated. Solutions based on other documents, such as British or European Standards, will have to be carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an appropriate manner."],
      "0.1.6 Domestic and non-domestic buildings": ["Where any #DEFINED#building#TERM# contains both domestic uses and non-domestic uses, the appropriate parts from each Technical Handbook will need to be used to ensure the standards are complied with in full, for example a caretakers #DEFINED#flat#TERM# in an #DEFINED#office#TERM##DEFINED#building#TERM#. However, communal #DEFINED#rooms#TERM# or other areas in a block of #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# that are exclusively associated with the #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# should be considered using the domestic guidance. Examples of this might be a #DEFINED#room#TERM# used as an #DEFINED#office#TERM# for the operation of a #DEFINED#sheltered housing complex#TERM# or a lounge communal to a block of #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM#. It is also a general principle that where a #DEFINED#building#TERM# or part of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# might be seen as falling into more than one category it should be designed to meet the most stringent recommendations."],
      "0.1.7 Latest changes": ["The following is a summary of the changes which have been introduced since 1 May 2011. Very minor changes to text have not been included here.", [

It is not expected that the standards will change regularly as these are set in the building regulations and can only be changed with Parliamentary approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will be replaced more regularly than the standards themselves."],
      "0.1.9 Arrangement of Section 0": ["Section 0 is arranged to follow the actual regulations. This sub-section provides an introduction to the building standards system. Sub-section 0.2 covers regulations 1 and 2 which are the citation, commencement and interpretation. Sub-sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover the significant technical regulations with each sub-section setting out and discussing the regulation with the same number (sub-section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.). Regulation 16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by Scottish Ministers. These are the regulations on citation and commencement, interpretation, exempted buildings, #DEFINED#work#TERM# not requiring a warrant and the methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduced in 2007 to help with the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive."],
      "0.1.10 Certification": ["Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or #DEFINED#construction#TERM# for compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co-ordinate the #DEFINED#work#TERM# of various designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and experience required to certify compliance for the #DEFINED#work#TERM# covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or installation reliability in accordance with legislation."]

        ["#Li1_1#CE marking under the CPRMany materials are construction products that have CE marking under the CPR (305/2011/EU-CPR).   The CPR requires that construction products on the EU market covered by a harmonised European product standard should normally have CE marking. In addition, manufacturers of products not covered by a harmonised standard can choose to affix CE marking to their products by obtaining a European Technical Assessment. You can find a list of the harmonised product standards under the CPR on the NANDO information system see www.ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=cpd.hs.   CE marking includes the reference of the product standard and levels or classes of performance being declared against some or all of the characteristics covered by the standard. The CE marking should be on the product, its label, the packaging or accompanying documents. The CE symbol by itself does not necessarily indicate that the material is suitable for #DEFINED#building work#TERM#. In addition to CE marking, the product will have a declaration of performance containing more detailed information on the product. This may be a paper or electronic document, or it may be on a website.  It is essential to check that the declared performance is suitable for building work.In the absence of indications to the contrary, the verifier should assume that the information given in the CE marking and declaration of performance is accurate and reliable, and that the product meets the declared performances.   If the declared performance of a product is suitable for its intended use, the verifier should not prohibit or impede the use of the product. ", "#Li1_2#CE marking under other EU Directives and Regulations Products may have CE marking under other European legislation, such as the Gas Appliances Directive (2009/142/EC) or the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC). Such CE marking shows that the product meets the essential requirements set out in the legislation, for example, minimum safety requirements, and can be placed on the EU market.  Some products will have CE marking in accordance with both the CPR and other legislation. The CE marking shows that the product complies with the requirements in all relevant EU legislation. ", "#Li1_3#British Standards Nearly all British Standards for construction products are the British version of harmonised European Standards used for CE marking. The British Standards Institution (BSI) numbering policy is to adopt the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) numbering, prefaced with BS e.g. BS EN 197-1: 2000.   Some British Standards are the British version of non-harmonised European standards; these also adopt the CEN numbering, prefaced with BS. These do not contain an Annex ZA, so CE marking cannot be affixed to products made to these standards.   Some British Standards for products not covered by a European standard will continue to exist.   Where a construction product has been made and assessed in accordance with one or more British Standards, this may show whether the product is suitable for its intended use.         ", "#Li1_4#Other national and international technical specificationsAn international technical specification, including those prepared by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) #DEFINED#http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html#TERM#, or on a national technical specification of a country other than the UK, may be used to demonstrate that a product not covered by a harmonised European standard meets the performance requirements of the Building Regulations.   Where necessary, the `relevant person' who intends to carry out the #DEFINED#work#TERM# should obtain translations of specifications to demonstrate how the material meets the requirements of regulation 8.  It should be noted that the national technical specifications of other EU Member States (and non-EU countries that are full members of CEN) are being progressively replaced by harmonised European standards, as is the case with British Standards. ", "#Li1_5#Independent certification schemes There are many independent product certification schemes in the UK and elsewhere which may be a further source of information on product performance. Such schemes certify that a material complies with the requirements of a recognised document and indicates it is suitable for its intended use. These may be in addition to, but not conflict with, CE marking. It should be noted that, materials which are not certified by an independent scheme may still conform to a relevant standard.   Accreditation of a certification body by a national accreditation body belonging to the European co-operation on Accreditation (EA) provides a means of demonstrating that their certification scheme can be relied upon.  In the UK, most independent certification bodies are accredited by UK Accreditation Service (UKAS), which belongs to the EA.   It is important to check the scope of the accreditation of certification body, as accreditation may cover only part of the certification body's testing or certification business.   ", "#Li1_6#Tests and calculations Where there is no relevant harmonised European standard, tests, calculation or other means may be used to demonstrate that materials will be capable of performing the function for which they are intended. UKAS or an equivalent national accreditation body belonging to the EA may accredit the testing laboratories.  This accreditation provides a means of showing that such tests can be relied on.

Fires can have a devastating effect on the lives of people and results in around 40 deaths and 900 injuries each year. The most common cause of accidental fires in #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# involved cooking appliances (62%), electrical supply or electrical lighting (14%), combustibles ignited due to being too close to candles or other heat source (9%), the remaining 15% is accounted for by the careless disposal of cigarettes and matches and other domestic appliances. Evidence also shows that the consumption of alcohol and/or smoking are contributory factors which increases the risk of an accidental fire occurring. Occupants who are alone at the time of the fire and are in the #DEFINED#room#TERM# of fire origin, are more likely to suffer injury (e.g. burns and smoke inhalation) or even death in some cases.", "It is impossible to eliminate the risks from fire altogether and the prevention of deliberate or accidental fires caused by the actions of occupants within a #DEFINED#dwelling#TERM# are outside the scope of building standards. For advice on best practice relating to fire safety in the home, visit the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service website #DEFINED#http://www.firescotland.gov.uk/#TERM# or contact the community fire safety team at your local fire station. Although beyond the scope of this guidance, the adoption of good fire safety practices should be encouraged to reduce the risk of fire occurring in the first place. Fire prevention will not only save lives but will protect property and reduce environmental pollution.", "The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The #DEFINED#building#TERM# elements, materials, components or other parts of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# identified in the guidance should follow the appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance. However where an element, material, component, or other part of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# is covered by more than one standard, the more demanding guidance should be followed in most cases."],

Occupants in #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# do not normally perceive themselves to be at risk from fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can spread. The risk to occupants is greater if they are asleep during the outbreak of fire as they are likely to be roused more slowly. Occupants should be warned as soon as possible following the outbreak of fire and the guidance to Standard 2.11 provides recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#.", "Fire and rescue service - in some cases, occupants will not react quickly enough before being overcome by the effects of the fire and smoke and as a result, may require to be rescued by the fire and rescue service. For facilities to assist the fire and rescue service, see Standards 2.12 to 2.14.", "Sustainability - the building regulations are primarily concerned with the protection of people from the dangers inherent in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, rather than protecting the owners of #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# from any economic loss which might occur.

      "2.0.7 Alternative approaches": ["Alternative means of complying with building standards - the guidance contained within this Technical Handbook indicates one or sometimes more than one means of complying with the mandatory building standards 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it is envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing that compliance with the building standards has been achieved.", "However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the guidance it cannot cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or new methods of construction. In such cases the designer or engineer will be required to show, by alternative means, that compliance with the building standards will be achieved in the completed building. For example, where the elements of structure are engineered timber (including cross laminated timber), the structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and fully developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on intervention from the fire and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible elements of structure may require to be provided to protect the structure against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. Where encapsulation (i.e. both physically and in terms of the period of fire resistance duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible material against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire, the structural fire engineer should consider the additional contribution of the exposed combustible material to the fire load density including an assessment of the structural stability of the building due to both potential delamination and failure of the fixings at elevated temperatures.", "Fire safety engineering - it is reasonable to demonstrate compliance with the functional standards by alternative means and in such cases, the fire engineer, the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early in the design process.", "Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a satisfactory level of fire safety in some large and complex #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# or where innovative or new methods of construction are used. In such cases a holistic approach is desirable from first principles rather than following, in part or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical Handbooks. In such cases the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.", "For many projects it is likely that designers will follow the guidance in the Technical Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be necessary. In its simplest form the QDR team may define the acceptance criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.", "However, it is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged relatively late in the design process to resolve fire safety issues raised during the verification or, in extreme cases, the construction process. This is unhelpful as fire engineers are often commissioned to resolve specific issues where the design does not follow the guidance rather than assessing the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise against unrealistic worse case scenarios of a ``code compliant'' design to justify deviations. This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that the safety goals are well defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of safety. The objective of a comparative study should be to demonstrate that the building design, as a whole, presents no greater risk to the occupants than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the Technical Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks would not merit such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there may be instances where small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a ``whole building'' fire engineered design and inevitably involves a degree of negotiation without the need for detailed analysis.", "Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the appointment of a fire engineer. Reference could be made to `A simplified approach to alternative fire safety strategies' Scottish Government (2010), which provides additional advice.", "Existing buildings - it may be appropriate to vary the guidance contained in this Handbook when assessing the guidance against the constraints in existing #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# especially those #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# which are listed in terms of their architectural or historic interest. In such cases, it would be appropriate to take into account a range of fire safety features, some of which are dealt with in this Handbook and some of which are not addressed in any detail. For more detailed information, guidance is contained in the `Guide for Practitioners 6 - Conversion of traditional buildings' (Historic Scotland).", "Fire engineering designs can be complex and many require extensive use of engineering judgement. The following documents are cited to ensure that the guidance given encompasses best practice worldwide:", [

      ], "The use of either document assumes that those carrying out or assessing a fire engineering approach have sufficient technical training, knowledge and experience to understand fully the risks involved.", "The objectives of any fire safety strategy should be established first and designers and verifiers should be aware of the importance of the design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure that the fire safety objectives have been met.", "Responsible person - it is important that owners/responsible person understand that the fire safety measures installed in a #DEFINED#building#TERM# need to be maintained and tested over the life time of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# so that they will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the fire engineering strategy are capable of being maintained and deployed over the lifetime of the #DEFINED#building#TERM#. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary due to changes to the #DEFINED#building#TERM# layout, the original strategy may need to be re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised. For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as amended.", "Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety for a specific #DEFINED#building#TERM#, structure or installation. In this regard the fire safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard, assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The `tools' that support fire engineering can include calculation methods which are used to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions are maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust fan in a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the smoke layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a stand-by fan.", "It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified above aim to provide a structured framework for assessing the interaction between, #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, people and fire, and to facilitate innovation in design without compromising safety. They provide information on how to undertake a detailed analysis of specific aspects of fire safety engineering in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#.", "In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering approach to fire safety which can be applied to new or existing #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# to show that the functional standards have been met.", "BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety engineering principles to the design of buildings is supported by 7 published documents:", [

Some, but not all, premises in which a ``housing support service'' is provided may also be required to comply e.g. where a House in Multiple Occupation licence is required, etc. It is important that a proportionate approach is taken to ensure the fire safety of the occupants in the event of an outbreak of fire and as such, the dutyholder should take account of the level of dependency of the residents when carrying out a fire risk assessment. Additional fire safety measures including automatic fire suppression may be required in those premises where highly vulnerable occupants cannot self-evacuate the building, for example, where the occupant is bed-ridden or has limited mental capacity and may not respond to the fire alarm.", "Where care services are to be provided in a domestic setting to which the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 does not apply, the safety of the occupants in the event of an outbreak of fire must still be considered.

The added benefit of automatic fire suppression in #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# means that the damage and disruption caused by fire is greatly reduced.", "Automatic suppression systems react to heat therefore, the greatest protection is afforded to those occupants outwith the #DEFINED#room#TERM# of fire origin. Automatic suppression may provide some benefit to occupants in the #DEFINED#room#TERM# of fire origin where for example the fire growth is fast and the temperatures allow the sprinkler system (normally 1 or 2 heads) to open early in the development phase of the fire. The spray pattern delivered from the sprinkler heads should control fire spread. Whilst the effect of sprinkler spray will increase the smoke volume and could obscure #DEFINED#exits#TERM#, smoke temperatures and toxicity will be greatly reduced. In some cases, the fire might be extinguished if the fire is not shielded from the sprinkler spray.", "While supporting the installation of automatic fire suppression systems in buildings, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) advises that claims involving the escape of water are increasing year on year, costing the insurance industry in Britain pounds 892 million in 2019.

The policy note may be downloaded from the resource section of Scottish Water's website. However, there is still a need for developers and designers to discuss project specific details with Scottish Water to determine what supply is likely to be available and what pressure can be expected. It is recognised that pressures will vary during the day and night, over the year and perhaps in future years. Therefore, it is imperative that the system is designed on the basis of what the minimum pressure and flow is likely to be. If there is any doubt, a tank and pump arrangement should be used.", "Therefore, it is strongly recommended that housing developers should consult Scottish Water and the suppression system contractor early in the design process.

Other issues such as condensation have been a constant threat to people and #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# for many years.", "Industrial change and demographic shift during the 19th and 20th centuries resulted in large-scale re-organisation of our villages, towns and cities. Industries moved out or disappeared altogether leaving large, 'brownfield', gaps in our landscape. At the same time, changes in heating methods and the advent of the consumer society, have had a significant effect on the type and volume of refuse it has been necessary to dispose of to landfill. Inevitably, these changes have left behind a legacy of land contamination that in some cases, may be harmful. The Scottish Government encourages the use of previously developed land (brownfield) and local authorities may wish to promote brownfield land in preference to greenfield land. Some of this land will be contaminated and will need to be made safe.", "Climate is controlled by the long-term balance of energy of the Earth and its atmosphere. Natural events cause changes in climate but human activities can also change the climate. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities will change the climate by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in the Earth's average surface temperature resulting in heavier rainfall.", "Indoor air quality complaints are frequently associated with comfort issues: high or low temperatures, draughts, high or low humidity or poor lighting. However the incidence of real indoor pollution should not be ignored, it is surprisingly common. The #DEFINED#construction#TERM# quality of #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# is improving with a resulting reduction of adventitious air infiltration producing fewer air changes. Inadequate ventilation, inefficient filtration and poor hygiene all contribute to poor indoor air quality.", "Carbon monoxide (CO) gas has no smell, taste or colour and it kills dozens of people in their homes every year. Many more suffer debilitating illnesses often without anybody realising that they are being poisoned. CO gas is produced by combustion appliances such as fires, boilers and water heaters. Any appliance that burns solid fuel, gas or oil and that does not have a room-sealed balanced flue so that it is sealed off from the #DEFINED#room#TERM#, is capable of poisoning you if it is not properly installed, maintained and serviced. The highest incidence of CO poisoning occurs in #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#.", "Oil accounts for about a third of all reported pollution incidents in Scotland that are investigated by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). That means around 500 to 600 pollution incidents a year with about 10 to 12% being serious. It is an offence to cause pollution and courts now impose heavy fines. Although domestic pollution is low compared with commercial and industrial #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, it is important to ensure standards are not lowered.", "Disposal of #DEFINED#wastewater#TERM# and #DEFINED#surface water#TERM# also needs to be carefully considered to prevent environmental pollution and uncontrollable run-off during periods of heavy rainfall leading to flooding. The incorporation of water conservation measures in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# can reduce pressure on precious water resources by recycling water from certain types of appliance. Recycling can also reduce the reliance on mains water and limit the amount of water discharged thus alleviating the risk of flooding. The inclusion of `green roofs' into #DEFINED#building#TERM# design can also provide benefits to the environment and #DEFINED#building#TERM# owners alike. Although viewed as mainly a vernacular #DEFINED#building#TERM# practice renewed interest is being shown in this technique due to the diverse benefits that can be achieved, such as:", [

      "3.1.0 Introduction": ["Land contamination is an unwanted legacy of Britain's long industrial history. Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by Section 57 of the Environment Act 1995) was introduced to enable the identification and remediation of contaminated land from which contamination currently represents an unacceptable risk. Risks associated with the land's future use will continue to be dealt with under the planning and building standards system. Some functions of Part IIA, planning and building standards regimes may, at times, overlap.", "Public registers - Part IIA adopts a `suitable for use approach' that requires the current risks to be assessed and remediated as required, for a site's existing use. The primary regulatory role for this rests with the local authorities. Local authorities and SEPA must establish public registers to record all prescribed regulatory action taken under Part IIA. The register will contain particulars relating to the remediation, as well as notifications of the identification of contaminated land. The registers will expand as new information is identified.", "Section 78A(2) of the Act (as amended) provides a specific definition of `contaminated land' for the purpose of the Act. Land that is not `contaminated land' as defined under the Act may still contain harmful or dangerous substances and the following guidance should be useful to the local authority in carrying out its other functions.", "Pan 33 - land confirmed, or suspected of being contaminated is a material consideration when local authorities determine planning applications. The key role of the planning system is to ensure that all the ground included within the planning application is suitable for the proposed future use. Conditions may be added to any permission given to ensure the required remediation takes place. Planning Advice Note (PAN) 33 `Development of Contaminated Land' explains further the role of planning and includes useful cross-references to other relevant publications and regimes.", "Harmful or dangerous substances include deposits of faecal or animal matter and any substance, or mixture of substances, which is, or could become, corrosive, explosive, flammable, radioactive or toxic or which produces, or could produce, any gas likely to have any such characteristic.", "Conversions - in the case of #DEFINED#conversions#TERM#, as specified in regulation 4, the #DEFINED#building#TERM# as #DEFINED#converted#TERM# shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is #DEFINED#reasonably practicable#TERM#, and in no case be worse than before the #DEFINED#conversion#TERM# (regulation 12, schedule 6)."],

The term `ground immediately adjoining' is intended to cover ground that is disturbed as a direct result of the #DEFINED#works#TERM#.", "The solum (prepared area within the containing walls of a #DEFINED#building#TERM#) should be treated to prevent vegetable growth and reduce the evaporation of moisture from the ground to the inner surface of any part of a #DEFINED#dwelling#TERM# that it could damage.", "The solum should be brought to an even surface and any upfilling should be of hard, inert material. See guidance to Standard 3.4 relating to #DEFINED#building#TERM# elements adjacent to the ground.", "To prevent water collecting under the #DEFINED#building#TERM#, the solum should be not lower than the highest level of the adjoining ground. However where this may not be possible, such as on sloping ground, the solum should be laid to fall to an outlet in the underbuilding above the lowest level of the adjoining ground to prevent any water build up below the #DEFINED#building#TERM#. Any part of the underbuilding that is in contact with the ground, such as on sloping ground, should be tanked see clause 3.4.7.", "Where the #DEFINED#site#TERM# contains fill or made ground, consideration should be given to its compressibility and its collapse potential.

The guidance to this standard deals with discharges to land via infiltration systems.

The guidance to this standard should be used in conjunction with the guidance to Standard 3.8 when designing wastewater treatment systems.", "Several hundreds of wastewater treatment systems are thought to cause pollution problems every year.

This trial hole will enable the sub-soil type to be determined. The trial hole should be a minimum of 2m deep, or a minimum of 1.5m below the invert of the proposed distribution pipes. The trial hole should be left covered for a period of 48 hours before measuring any water table level. Subsoils that overlay bedrock allow water to move through the pore spaces between the grains of material of which they are composed. They are the first line of defence against pollution and act as a protecting filtering layer. Where these materials are unsaturated, pollution attenuation processes are often enhanced. Water flows through much of Scotland's bedrock via fissures. Attenuation of contaminants is limited in these cases. For safe and effective dispersal of the #DEFINED#wastewater#TERM#, the groundwater and bedrock should be at least 1m below the bottom of the distribution pipes. It should also be noted that it is the seasonally highest level of the water table that should be determined for the infiltration area.", "Third, to determine the type of infiltration system and the area of ground required, percolation tests should be carried out.

Fill the 300mm square section of the holes to a depth of at least 300mm with water and allow them to seep away overnight. It is important to saturate the soil surrounding the test holes to simulate day to day conditions in an operational drainage field. Next day, refill the test sections of the percolation holes with water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time (t) in seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% to 25% full level. Divide this time by 150mm. The answer gives the average time in seconds (Vp) required for the water to drop 1mm.

In 2010-11 Fire fighters attended 1565 #DEFINED#chimney#TERM# fires  in Scotland. The main cause of these fires was inadequate maintenance of the #DEFINED#chimneys#TERM#, including routine cleaning of #DEFINED#flues#TERM#. ", "Combustion appliances fuelled by solid fuel, oil or gas all have the potential to cause carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning if they are poorly installed or commissioned, inadequately maintained or incorrectly used. Inadequate ventilation or a lack of the correct maintenance of appliances, #DEFINED#flues#TERM# and #DEFINED#chimneys#TERM# are the main causes of CO poisoning. Poisonous CO gas is produced when fuel does not burn properly. Incidents of poisoning can also occur through deterioration of the structure of the #DEFINED#flue#TERM# or #DEFINED#chimney#TERM#. Every year in Scotland there are fatalities from CO poisoning directly attributed to combustion appliances installed in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#. In addition to these deaths there are also a considerable number of incidents where people are treated in hospital for the effects of CO poisoning. In some cases CO poisoning can result in serious and permanent injury to persons affected. Where CO gas may occur within a #DEFINED#building#TERM# early detection and warning can play a vital role in the protection and safety of the occupants. This is particularly important in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# with sleeping accommodation.", "Incorrect sizing of #DEFINED#flues#TERM# can also have serious repercussions. If a #DEFINED#flue#TERM# is too small, an insufficient volume of air will pass through it and this may lead to spillage of combustion gases. Too large a #DEFINED#flue#TERM# will slow down the flow of combustion gases and this may also lead to spillage.", "The use of fanned #DEFINED#flues#TERM# allows combustion appliances to be located away from external walls. In such installations the #DEFINED#flues#TERM# can often be concealed within ceiling or wall voids making it difficult to determine whether the #DEFINED#flue#TERM# is still in good condition when an appliance is serviced or maintained.  ", "Damaged or poorly maintained #DEFINED#flues#TERM# can allow CO gases to escape from the #DEFINED#flue#TERM# before the intended termination point.

      "5.0.1 Background": ["Noise is unwanted sound. In order to limit the effects of unwanted sound the standards intend to improve the resistance of #DEFINED#building#TERM# elements to sound transmission. Research has presented clear evidence that noise can indirectly contribute to a range of health issues such as stress and anxiety.", "Inadequate sound insulation can impair health by allowing noise from other people to disrupt normal life. A number of people in attached homes complain of neighbour noise. The World Health Organisation has established a relationship between noise exposure and sleep disturbance. However, the short or long-term effects are still not clear. Over the years, several pieces of legislation relating to noise (see clause 5.0.9) have been introduced which provide some degree of control of `noisy neighbours'.", "Noise generated within a dwelling, to some extent, is under the control of the occupants but can still create tension within a family. The provision of sound absorption between rooms should allow people a degree of privacy as they go about their everyday activities."],
      "5.0.2 Aims": ["The purpose of the standards in Section 5 is to limit the transmission of sound to a level that will not threaten the health of occupants from sound transmission emanating from attached #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and a differently occupied part of the same #DEFINED#building#TERM#. They also cover sound from within the same #DEFINED#dwelling#TERM# if occupants are in #DEFINED#rooms#TERM# where they would expect to have some degree of peace and quiet.", "It is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee freedom from unwanted sound transmission. The standards aim to limit the effects from sound levels created from normal domestic activities, but not from excessive noise from things such as power tools, audio systems inconsiderately played at high volume or even raised voices. The standards do not address environmental noise through the #DEFINED#building#TERM# facade from sources such as aircraft, trains, road traffic or industry. Other legislation covers these areas and further information may be obtained from Planning Advice Note PAN 1/2011 `Planning and Noise'.", "Home improvements were previously not considered an issue, whereas some can now create a noise nuisance. For example, lifting carpets and replacing them with laminate flooring can have an adverse affect on sound transference in buildings, and particularly on occupants of flats. A leaflet giving further information on home improvements is available at #DEFINED#http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/built-environment/building/building-standards#TERM#."],

      ]],
      "5.0.4 Explanation of terms": ["There are a number of terms used in this section some are included below, these and other useful terms are included in Annex A of the Example Constructions.", "Airborne sound is sound which is propagated from a noise source through the medium of air. Examples of these are speech and sound from a television.", "Airborne sound transmission is direct transmission of airborne sound through walls or floors. When sound energy is created in a #DEFINED#room#TERM#, for instance by conversation, some of the energy is reflected or absorbed by #DEFINED#room#TERM# surfaces but some may set up vibrations in the walls and floor. Depending on both the amount of energy and the type of #DEFINED#construction#TERM#, this can result in sound being transmitted to adjacent parts of the #DEFINED#building#TERM#.", "Direct transmission refers to the path of either airborne or impact sound through elements of #DEFINED#construction#TERM#.", "DnT,w is the weighted standardised level difference. A single-number quantity (weighted) which characterises the airborne sound insulation between two #DEFINED#rooms#TERM#, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1: 1997.", "Flanking transmission is airborne or impact transmission between #DEFINED#rooms#TERM# that is transmitted via flanking elements and/or in flanking elements in conjunction with the main separating elements. An example of a flanking element is the inner leaf of an external wall that connects to the separating `core' of a wall or floor.", "Impact sound is sound which is propagated from a noise source through a direct medium. An example of this is footfall on a floor.", "Impact sound transmission is sound which is spread from an impact noise source in direct contact with a #DEFINED#building#TERM# element.", "L'nT,w is the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level. A single-number quantity (weighted) to characterise the impact sound insulation of floors, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-2: 1997.", "Rw is a single number quantity (weighted) which characterises the airborne sound insulation of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# element from measurements undertaken in a laboratory, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1: 1997."],
      "5.0.5 Reduction of sound transmission": ["The reduction of sound transmission from attached #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, or part of the same building, and sound from within the same dwelling can be provided through different mechanisms which involve; mass, isolation, absorption, resilience and stiffness (see annex A of the Example Constructions). Wall and floor #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# that provide a combination of such mechanisms generally provide better sound insulation.", "Good design incorporates at least 2 or more of the above mechanisms and can reduce a range of sound frequencies typically found in attached dwellings.", "The effects these variables can have in predicting both sound transmission and insulation are as follows:", [
        ["#Li1_1#through a heavyweight wall or floor it is its mass per unit area. A reduction in sound transmission and increase in sound insulation are expected with increasing mass, as the heavier the wall or floor, the less it vibrates in response to sound waves and hence the less sound energy is radiated. For example, heavyweight #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# such as masonry cavity walls provide mass and isolation", "#Li1_2#through a lightweight wall or floor it is the use of cavities, isolation and absorption. A reduction in sound transmission and an increase in sound insulation are expected by the use of cavities with fewer and less stiff connections, while absorptive material hung in the wall cavity will absorb mid to high frequency sound energy. The formation of narrow cavities, such as dry linings on dabs, can also create an unwelcome `drum' effect at low frequencies and filling or lining them with absorbing material can help to reduce this. For example in lightweight #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# such as timber frame walls, the twin stud of the timber frame provides isolation, stiffness and absorption", "#Li1_3#resilience is needed for #DEFINED#separating floors#TERM# in #DEFINED#flats#TERM# where there is direct vibration impact such as footfall noise. Resilience reduces the impact vibration by dynamic movement and also #DEFINED#converts#TERM# the energy into heat. Examples of resilient elements for floors include floating floor treatments such as battens and cradles, resilient bars and resilient floor coverings, other than carpet", "#Li1_4#mass and stiffness help to reduce significantly low frequency sound transmission whereas absorption and resilience predominantly reduce mid and high frequency sound transmission", "#Li1_5#isolation has the most influence over all frequencies of sound but can be limited by structural connections such as wall ties, straps and fixings that may bridge isolated leafs or elements."]
      ], "#Figure1#all_figures_dict_key_65#EndFigure1"],
      "5.0.6 Principles of airborne sound transmission": ["When sound waves strike a wall or floor, the pressure variations cause the #DEFINED#construction#TERM# to vibrate. A portion of the vibrational energy on the sound source side will be transferred through the wall or floor where it is radiated as airborne sound on the other side. There is a loss in sound transmission as the frequency of the incident sound (sound waves produced from striking against a wall or floor for example) increases. This also varies with the direction of the sound waves, and is usually assumed to be the average for all possible angles of incidence."],
      "5.0.7 Principles of impact sound transmission": ["Impact sound is sound that is spread from an impact or vibrational source in direct contact with a #DEFINED#building#TERM# element such as a floor. A structural vibration is transmitted from the point of impact through the structure causing vibration leading to the radiation of sound into an adjacent #DEFINED#room#TERM# below. In a #DEFINED#building#TERM# this is commonly caused by an object hitting the floor, from where the vibration is transferred into the structure. Usually the vibration path will lead to the ceiling and perimeter walls below. The amount of impact sound heard below will depend upon many factors including the force of the impact, the vibration transmission characteristics of the floor #DEFINED#construction#TERM# and the floor covering."],
      "5.0.8 Principles of flanking sound transmission": ["Flanking sound transmission occurs when there is an indirect path for sound to travel along elements adjacent to walls and floors. If the flanking #DEFINED#construction#TERM# and its connections with the separating structure are not correctly detailed, flanking transmission can equal, or even exceed, sound levels perceived as a result of direct transmission. Flanking transmission can occur, for instance, when a wall abuts the face of the inner leaf of an external cavity wall, and the walls are insufficiently tied or bonded together, thus allowing the noise to travel along the inner leaf."],
      "5.0.9 Relevant legislation": ["Listed below are some pieces of legislation and guidance that may be relevant and/or helpful to those using the guidance in this particular section.", "The Common Law of Nuisance recognises that an occupant has the right to the free and absolute use of the property, but only to the extent that such use does not discomfort or annoy a neighbour.", "Part IV of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 sets out a range of public nuisance offences.", "The Environmental Protection Act 1990 as it relates to noise, states that `any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance ranks as a statutory nuisance'.", "The Human Rights Act 1998 (as it relates to noise) Article 8 guarantees the right to respect for private and family life. ", "The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 empowers the local authority to serve a warning notice in relation to noise which exceeds the permitted level.", "The Planning Advice Note PAN 1/2011 `Planning and Noise', provides advice on the role of the planning system in helping to prevent and limit the adverse effects of noise."],
      "5.0.10 Certification": ["Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or #DEFINED#construction#TERM# for compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co-ordinate the #DEFINED#work#TERM# of various designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and experience required to certify compliance for the #DEFINED#work#TERM# covered by the scope of the scheme.

Music can be more bass orientated and played at higher volumes, whilst speakers mounted on walls may improve the quality to the listener, they can create a disturbance to others.

It follows that the process of sustainable development and the quality of `sustainability' to aspire to within the built environment should account for: ", [

      ], "The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 allows Scottish Ministers to regulate for the purpose of furthering the achievement of sustainable development. In Scotland, sustainability is embedded into the building regulations for all new buildings, rather than reference being made to new buildings achieving levels within a voluntary system. Since 2005, progress has been made by strengthening the standards on, for example, energy efficiency and accessibility for all new buildings so they are comparable with the best in Europe.", "Whilst the standards within Sections 1 - 6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks deliver a level of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy efficiency, surface water drainage and sound insulation, there is always the possibility of going beyond the minimum standard. Scottish Ministers consider that it is not practicable at this time to require every building to incorporate higher performance standards or further sustainability measures. However developers may wish to gain recognition for building to higher standards. Additionally, organisations such as planning authorities or funding bodies may choose to make constructing to a higher level of sustainability a condition of approval or funding. ", "Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher quality buildings to be created and for such benefits to be formally recognised. The introduction of Section 7 is the next step in encouraging the sustainable design and construction of all new buildings within a broader context of sustainable development. Further reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new buildings will also assist in meeting targets within the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.  "],

      "7.0.3 Scope": ["The measures on sustainability are broadly related to the built form but some matters that are associated with sustainable development such as location and transport cannot be adequately delivered by the building standards system. The scope of the measures can be divided into two sets: ", [

Reducing water use will reduce the energy consumed and the carbon emissions associated with distributing, processing and heating of water. It is also important that building occupants have the opportunity to understand how their behaviour can reduce use of these resources. ", "#Li1_2#Quality of life; material use and waste - Homes should be designed to accommodate flexible living, working and studying patterns for individuals, groups and families. More aspects of designing for well-being, such as daylighting rooms more effectively and protecting from noise from adjacent buildings, should be promoted for all new home occupants."]
      ], "There are areas considered inappropriate for inclusion in the optional upper levels for domestic buildings due to the complexity of some subjects related to building design such as material sourcing and embodied energy. However the Sullivan Report ('A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland'; published by Scottish Ministers in 2007) recommends total-life zero carbon buildings by 2030. This standard can respond in due course to the growing relative importance of embodied energy as the performance of new buildings improves further. At present these areas are outside the scope of this standard. Reference to external examples of guidance that allow appraisal of local or ethical construction material sourcing, embodied energy and use of recycled materials are the BRE's Green Guide to Specification (www.bre.co.uk) and the materials section on www.greenspec.co.uk"],
      "7.0.4 Explanation of terms": ["Aspect is a term used for a subject area of sustainability.

Upper levels in some aspects may become absorbed into guidance in Sections 1 to 6 to meet revised mandatory functional standards following future reviews of these sections.

Directions to local authorities, which enable the following measures, are published on the Building Standards Division website. "],
      "7.0.8 Certification": ["Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or construction for compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co-ordinate the work of various designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under the scheme are assessed to make sure that they have the qualifications, skills and experience to certify compliance for the work covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or installation reliability in accordance with legislation. "],
      "7.0.9 Other sustainability indicators": ["Other tools to assess a level of sustainability for new buildings exist and are used in Scotland. These indicators may be selected as appropriate for some developments because they cover issues such as location, orientation on site, or transport that are broader than building regulations can include. Other established indicators place greater emphasis on the sourcing and embodied energy of construction materials, an area flagged up in this section for future review.
