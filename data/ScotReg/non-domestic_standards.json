      ], "This document gives guidance on how to comply with these regulations.", "This is one of two Technical Handbooks, one covering #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# and the other non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#. These Technical Handbooks have been issued by Scottish Ministers for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of the provisions of the building regulations under a notice given in accordance with Section 4(2) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. Each Handbook has eight sections. Section 0, this section, is identical in both Handbooks. It covers general issues and sets out how and when the regulations apply to #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and #DEFINED#works#TERM#.", "From the 2013 edition onwards, the Handbooks are published electronically and are available free on the Scottish Government, Building Standards Division website.", "Sections 1 to 7 give guidance on how to achieve the standards set by the regulations, and there are different sets for #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# and non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#.

They are:", "Section 1 Structure", "Section 2 Fire", "Section 3 Environment", "Section 4 Safety", "Section 5 Noise", "Section 6 Energy", "Section 7 Sustainability", "Each of the seven sections consists of an introduction and then general guidance on the standards within the section. This is followed by each standard which has specific introductory information and guidance on how to comply with the standard. At the end of the Handbook, after Section 7, there are the following two sections:", "Appendix A: Defined terms.", "Appendix B: List of standards and other publications.", "The Technical Handbooks are supported by a Procedural Handbook, published separately, which clarifies the intent of the Building (Scotland) Procedures Regulations 2004. A separate procedural guidance document for Crown #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# has also been produced."],
      "0.1.2 The Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004": ["This Technical Handbook gives guidance on achieving the standards set in the Building (Scotland) Regulations. The standards themselves can be found in schedule 5 to regulation 9, and are in the form of `expanded functional standards'. That is, the standards describe the functions a #DEFINED#building#TERM# should perform, such as `providing resistance to the spread of fire'.", "The Building (Scotland) Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers are subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament. The content of the regulations, so far as it relates to technical specifications, is also scrutinised by the European Commission (EC). The EC checks with all the other countries that have adopted the #DEFINED#Construction Products Regulations#TERM# (CPR) to ensure that no barriers to trade in #DEFINED#construction#TERM# products are created, either directly or indirectly by the way products are described.", "To meet the requirements of the CPR, materials and #DEFINED#construction#TERM# methods must be described by use of suitable European Standards wherever these exist. As there is a rolling programme of change to these National and European Standards, which includes conversion to, and the further provision of, ENs and harmonised ENs, the Handbooks have been designed to be readily updated. An explanation of the relevance and status of specific European and British standards referred to in the Handbooks is in the section concerned. There is also a list of the publications referred to in the Handbooks provided in Appendix B.", "The arrangement of Sections 1 - 7 within the Handbooks relates directly to the Basic Works Requirements of the CPR (as published by the EC), which #DEFINED#construction#TERM##DEFINED#works#TERM# are expected to satisfy when they have been properly designed and #DEFINED#built#TERM#. The arrangement is as follows:", "Section 1 Structure (EC - Mechanical resistance and stability)", "Section 2 Fire (EC - Safety in case of fire)", "Section 3 Environment (EC - Hygiene, health and the environment)", "Section 4 Safety (EC - Safety and accessibility in use)", "Section 5 Noise (EC - Protection against noise)", "Section 6 Energy (EC - Energy, economy and heat retention)", "Section 7 Sustainability (EC - Sustainable use of natural resources)"],
      "0.1.3 The building standards system": ["The building regulations are enforced through the building standards system that is established by the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act sets out the enabling powers that allow the Scottish Ministers to make, not only the building regulations, but also procedural regulations, fees regulations and the other supporting legislation needed to operate the system. The system is designed to ensure that new #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and #DEFINED#works#TERM# achieve the objectives of #DEFINED#the Act#TERM# in terms of health, safety, welfare, convenience, conservation of fuel and power, and sustainable development.", "The roles of those operating the building standards system are explained in detail in the guidance on the procedural regulations. Briefly, the duty to comply with the building regulations lies with the owner, or in some cases the client, for the #DEFINED#work#TERM#. Before #DEFINED#work#TERM# begins a building warrant must be obtained.", "For some simpler #DEFINED#works#TERM# a warrant is not required (see regulation 5 and schedule 3), but the regulations still apply. The owner or client again has the duty to comply. The role of issuing warrants and accepting completion certificates rests with verifiers, enforcement is by local authorities, and the system is overseen and updated by the Building Standards Division (BSD). BSD forms part of the Scottish Government and acts on behalf of, and is responsible to, Scottish Ministers. These bodies are further explained in the guidance to the procedural regulations.", "The building standards system is pre-emptive, ensuring so far as possible that the proposed #DEFINED#works#TERM# will comply with the regulations. It recognises that proposals can change during #DEFINED#construction#TERM#, so there are requirements for amendments to the proposals to be agreed and recorded. On completion, the owner or client must certify that the #DEFINED#works#TERM# have been #DEFINED#constructed#TERM# in accordance with the building warrant and the building regulations. The verifier will make reasonable inquiry to ensure the completion certificate is accurate before accepting the certificate. Usually an inspection of the #DEFINED#works#TERM# will be made, and on most projects some inspection of #DEFINED#work#TERM# in progress will also have been carried out. However verifiers cannot inspect all materials and #DEFINED#work#TERM# on every #DEFINED#building site#TERM#. It is the client that should put in place the contractual and practical arrangements needed to assure themselves that the desired quality of #DEFINED#work#TERM# has been achieved."],
      "0.1.4 Status of Technical Handbooks": ["The regulations are mandatory, but the choice of how to comply lies with the #DEFINED#building#TERM# owner. This Technical Handbook has been issued by Scottish Ministers, through the Building Standards Division, for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the building regulations. If the guidance is followed in full then this should be accepted by the verifier as indicating that the building regulations have been complied with. However it is quite acceptable to use alternative methods of compliance provided they fully satisfy the regulations.", "Failure to comply with the Technical Handbook does not render a person liable to civil or criminal procedures, but proof of compliance with the guidance may be relied on in any proceedings as tending to negative liability for an alleged contravention of the building regulations.", "Following the advice in the Technical Handbooks is therefore likely to be the normal way of complying with the building regulations. However, a designer may put forward other ways of meeting the regulations, in the form of alternative solutions.", "There are a further three guidance documents that have the same standing as the Technical Handbooks. Scottish Ministers have issued these under Section 4(1) of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. They are:", [

      ], "In due course other documents may be issued by Scottish Ministers to provide further guidance. Such guidance might deal with specific #DEFINED#building#TERM# types, or provide alternative methods of showing compliance with those provided in the Technical Handbooks."],
      "0.1.5 Alternative solutions": ["The use of expanded functional standards, backed up by detailed guidance, provides a flexible system of control. Consideration of alternative solutions is assisted by the expansion of the functional standards previously used in the building standards regulations to clarify the necessary properties of each #DEFINED#building#TERM#. The need for a formal relaxation of standards is reduced as meeting the full details of given solutions is no longer mandatory. The professional judgement of the verifier, assisted by guidance on questions referred to Scottish Ministers, through the Building Standards Division, decides whether a standard is met.", "In considering alternative solutions, however it is necessary to have regard to the details of this guidance. Where performance standards or policy statements are given, every part of the solution is expected to meet them. As a result, alternative solutions that appear suitable may not be acceptable in detail. For example, some of the solutions offered in relation to the English and Welsh building regulations, in the `Approved Documents' (ADs), are not suitable because the levels of thermal insulation recommended are not the same. Similarly different approaches are taken to the control of fire size and the design of #DEFINED#compartmentation#TERM# which means that #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# meeting the AD on fire safety may not be acceptable. This will vary in time as both ADs and the Scottish Technical Handbooks are updated. Solutions based on other documents, such as British or European Standards, will have to be carefully evaluated to see if the Scottish standards are being met in an appropriate manner."],
      "0.1.6 Domestic and non-domestic buildings": ["Where any #DEFINED#building#TERM# contains both domestic uses and non-domestic uses, the appropriate parts from each Technical Handbook will need to be used to ensure the standards are complied with in full, for example a caretakers #DEFINED#flat#TERM# in an #DEFINED#office#TERM##DEFINED#building#TERM#. However, communal #DEFINED#rooms#TERM# or other areas in a block of #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# that are exclusively associated with the #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM# should be considered using the domestic guidance. Examples of this might be a #DEFINED#room#TERM# used as an #DEFINED#office#TERM# for the operation of a #DEFINED#sheltered housing complex#TERM# or a lounge communal to a block of #DEFINED#dwellings#TERM#. It is also a general principle that where a #DEFINED#building#TERM# or part of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# might be seen as falling into more than one category it should be designed to meet the most stringent recommendations."],
      "0.1.7 Latest changes": ["The following is a summary of the changes which have been introduced since 1 May 2011. Very minor changes to text have not been included here.", [
        ["#Li1_1#\nStandard 0.8 - completely re-written for the CPR.\n", "#Li1_2#\nStandard 0.9 - change to the name of Section 4, Safety and Section 6, Energy to reflect Construction Product Regulation requirements.\n", "#Li1_3#\nRegulation 3, Type 1 of schedule 1 - updated to reflect the replacement of the Explosive Regulations 2005 by the 2014 version.\n", "#Li1_4#\nRegulation 5, Type 23A of schedule 3 - introduction of new building type 23A for detached single-storey buildings used for shelter or sleeping in connection with recreation.\n", "#Li1_5#\nRegulation 9  - updated for new building type 23A in schedule 3 to regulation 5.\n"]

It is not expected that the standards will change regularly as these are set in the building regulations and can only be changed with Parliamentary approval. Therefore it is anticipated that the guidance will be replaced more regularly than the standards themselves."],
      "0.1.9 Arrangement of Section 0": ["Section 0 is arranged to follow the actual regulations. This sub-section provides an introduction to the building standards system. Sub-section 0.2 covers regulations 1 and 2 which are the citation, commencement and interpretation. Sub-sections 0.3 to 0.15 cover the significant technical regulations with each sub-section setting out and discussing the regulation with the same number (sub-section 0.3 covering regulation 3 etc.). Regulation 16 establishes which regulations cannot ever be relaxed by Scottish Ministers. These are the regulations on citation and commencement, interpretation, exempted buildings, #DEFINED#work#TERM# not requiring a warrant and the methods of measurement. Regulation 17 was introduced in 2007 to help with the implementation of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive."],
      "0.1.10 Certification": ["Scottish Ministers can, under Section 7 of the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, approve schemes for the certification of design or #DEFINED#construction#TERM# for compliance with the mandatory functional standards. Such schemes are approved on the basis that the procedures adopted by the scheme will take account of the need to co-ordinate the #DEFINED#work#TERM# of various designers and specialist contractors. Individuals approved to provide certification services under the scheme are assessed to ensure that they have the qualifications, skills and experience required to certify compliance for the #DEFINED#work#TERM# covered by the scope of the scheme. Checking procedures adopted by Approved Certifiers will deliver design or installation reliability in accordance with legislation."]

        ["#Li1_1#CE marking under the CPRMany materials are construction products that have CE marking under the CPR (305/2011/EU-CPR).   The CPR requires that construction products on the EU market covered by a harmonised European product standard should normally have CE marking. In addition, manufacturers of products not covered by a harmonised standard can choose to affix CE marking to their products by obtaining a European Technical Assessment. You can find a list of the harmonised product standards under the CPR on the NANDO information system see www.ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=cpd.hs.   CE marking includes the reference of the product standard and levels or classes of performance being declared against some or all of the characteristics covered by the standard. The CE marking should be on the product, its label, the packaging or accompanying documents. The CE symbol by itself does not necessarily indicate that the material is suitable for #DEFINED#building work#TERM#. In addition to CE marking, the product will have a declaration of performance containing more detailed information on the product. This may be a paper or electronic document, or it may be on a website.  It is essential to check that the declared performance is suitable for building work.In the absence of indications to the contrary, the verifier should assume that the information given in the CE marking and declaration of performance is accurate and reliable, and that the product meets the declared performances.   If the declared performance of a product is suitable for its intended use, the verifier should not prohibit or impede the use of the product. ", "#Li1_2#CE marking under other EU Directives and Regulations Products may have CE marking under other European legislation, such as the Gas Appliances Directive (2009/142/EC) or the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC). Such CE marking shows that the product meets the essential requirements set out in the legislation, for example, minimum safety requirements, and can be placed on the EU market.  Some products will have CE marking in accordance with both the CPR and other legislation. The CE marking shows that the product complies with the requirements in all relevant EU legislation. ", "#Li1_3#British Standards Nearly all British Standards for construction products are the British version of harmonised European Standards used for CE marking. The British Standards Institution (BSI) numbering policy is to adopt the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) numbering, prefaced with BS e.g. BS EN 197-1: 2000.   Some British Standards are the British version of non-harmonised European standards; these also adopt the CEN numbering, prefaced with BS. These do not contain an Annex ZA, so CE marking cannot be affixed to products made to these standards.   Some British Standards for products not covered by a European standard will continue to exist.   Where a construction product has been made and assessed in accordance with one or more British Standards, this may show whether the product is suitable for its intended use.         ", "#Li1_4#Other national and international technical specificationsAn international technical specification, including those prepared by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) #DEFINED#http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html#TERM#, or on a national technical specification of a country other than the UK, may be used to demonstrate that a product not covered by a harmonised European standard meets the performance requirements of the Building Regulations.   Where necessary, the `relevant person' who intends to carry out the #DEFINED#work#TERM# should obtain translations of specifications to demonstrate how the material meets the requirements of regulation 8.  It should be noted that the national technical specifications of other EU Member States (and non-EU countries that are full members of CEN) are being progressively replaced by harmonised European standards, as is the case with British Standards. ", "#Li1_5#Independent certification schemes There are many independent product certification schemes in the UK and elsewhere which may be a further source of information on product performance. Such schemes certify that a material complies with the requirements of a recognised document and indicates it is suitable for its intended use. These may be in addition to, but not conflict with, CE marking. It should be noted that, materials which are not certified by an independent scheme may still conform to a relevant standard.   Accreditation of a certification body by a national accreditation body belonging to the European co-operation on Accreditation (EA) provides a means of demonstrating that their certification scheme can be relied upon.  In the UK, most independent certification bodies are accredited by UK Accreditation Service (UKAS), which belongs to the EA.   It is important to check the scope of the accreditation of certification body, as accreditation may cover only part of the certification body's testing or certification business.   ", "#Li1_6#Tests and calculations Where there is no relevant harmonised European standard, tests, calculation or other means may be used to demonstrate that materials will be capable of performing the function for which they are intended. UKAS or an equivalent national accreditation body belonging to the EA may accredit the testing laboratories.  This accreditation provides a means of showing that such tests can be relied on.

Non-domestic #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# should be designed and #DEFINED#constructed#TERM# in such a way that the risk of fire is reduced and if a fire does occur, there are measures in place to restrict the growth of fire and smoke to enable the occupants to escape safely and fire-fighters to deal with fire safely and effectively.", "There are more than 2000 reported fires in non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# every year in Scotland. The most common cause of accidental fires in non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# is faulty appliances, accounting for more than 20% of fires followed by cooking at around 16%. Statistics also show that around 24% of fires in non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# are deliberately started. While the number of deaths from fires in non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# is less than #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# the potential for significant life loss and injuries is far greater. This is due to large occupancy capacities, building complexity, occupant capability and behaviour including the potential for delay in occupant evacuation following the outbreak of fire.", "In the event of an outbreak of fire, it is important that the occupants are warned as soon as possible. The guidance to Standard 2.11 provides recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# where people may be asleep or where there is a particularly high risk.", "The standards and guidance in this section are designed to work together to provide a balanced approach to fire safety. The #DEFINED#building#TERM# elements, materials, components or other parts of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# identified in the guidance should follow the appropriate performance levels that are recommended throughout the guidance. However where an element, material, component, or other part of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# is covered by more than one standard, the more demanding guidance should be followed in most cases."],

Occupants in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# do not normally perceive themselves to be at risk from fire and are not usually aware of the speed that fire can spread. The risk to occupants is greater if they are asleep during the outbreak of fire as they are likely to be roused more slowly. Occupants should be warned as soon as possible following the outbreak of fire and the guidance to Standard 2.11 provides recommendations for the installation of alarm and detection systems in non-#DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM#.", "Fire and rescue service - in some cases, occupants will not react quickly enough before being overcome by the effects of the fire and smoke and as a result, may require to be rescued by the fire and rescue service. For facilities to assist the fire and rescue service, see Standards 2.12 to 2.14.", "Sustainability - the #DEFINED#building#TERM# regulations are primarily concerned with the protection of people from the dangers inherent in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, rather than protecting the owners of #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# from any economic loss which might occur.

Therefore, methods of measurement unique to fire are described within the guidance under each of the relevant standards.", "The following guidance on measurements are unique to Section 2 Fire of the Handbooks and where appropriate, should be read in conjunction with the measurements specified in schedule 4 to regulation 7 as set out in Section 0 General.", "Plant storeys - for the purpose of measuring the height above ground to the top most #DEFINED#storey#TERM# of a #DEFINED#building#TERM#, roof-top plant areas and any top #DEFINED#storeys#TERM# consisting solely of plant rooms, should be excluded.", "An openwork floor is a floor with an open mesh decking which allows smoke to pass through.

      "2.0.7 Alternative approaches": ["Alternative means of complying with building standards - the guidance contained within this Technical Handbook indicates one or sometimes more than one means of complying with the mandatory building standards 2.1 to 2.15. In the majority of projects it is envisaged that meeting the guidance will be the usual means of showing that compliance with the building standards has been achieved.", "However, it should be appreciated that, due to the generic nature of the guidance it cannot cover all building designs or, for example, innovative or new methods of construction. In such cases the designer or engineer will be required to show, by alternative means, that compliance with the building standards will be achieved in the completed #DEFINED#building#TERM#. For example, where the elements of structure are engineered timber (including cross laminated timber), the structure should maintain stability during the fire growth and fully developed post flashover phases of the fire without reliance on intervention from the fire and rescue services. Encapsulation of combustible elements of structure may require to be provided to protect the structure against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire. Where encapsulation (i.e. both physically and in terms of the period of fire resistance duration) is not provided or does not protect the combustible material against ignition and charring for the duration of the fire, the structural fire engineer should consider the additional contribution of the exposed combustible material to the fire load density including an assessment of the structural stability of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# due to both potential delamination and failure of the fixings at elevated temperatures.", "Fire safety engineering - it is reasonable to demonstrate compliance with the functional standards by alternative means and in such cases, the fire engineer, the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted early in the design process.", "Fire safety engineering may be the only practical way to achieve a satisfactory level of fire safety in some large and complex #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# or where innovative or new methods of construction are used. In such cases a holistic approach is desirable from first principles rather than following, in part or wholly, the guidance contained in the Technical Handbooks. In such cases the building standards verifier and the fire and rescue service should be consulted as part of the Qualitative Design Review (QDR) process.", "For many projects it is likely that designers will follow the guidance in the Technical Handbooks and fire engineering techniques will not be necessary. In its simplest form the QDR team may define the acceptance criteria in terms of compliance with the Handbooks.", "However, it is common for fire engineers and regulators to be engaged relatively late in the design process to resolve fire safety issues raised during the verification or, in extreme cases, the construction process. This is unhelpful as fire engineers are often commissioned to resolve specific issues where the design does not follow the guidance rather than assessing the building holistically. This can lead to a comparative exercise against unrealistic worse case scenarios of a ``code compliant'' design to justify deviations. This is not the intent of the guidance and it is important that the safety goals are well defined and achieved with a sufficient margin of safety. The objective of a comparative study should be to demonstrate that the building design, as a whole, presents no greater risk to the occupants than a similar type of building designed in accordance with the Technical Handbook guidance. Further, it is common for the inappropriate use of Computational Fluid Dynamics where the deviations from the Handbooks would not merit such an exercise to be carried out. It is recognised that there may be instances where small deviations from the guidance do not warrant a ``whole building'' fire engineered design and inevitably involves a degree of negotiation without the need for detailed analysis.", "Not all cases of variance from the guidance will require the appointment of a fire engineer. Reference could be made to `A simplified approach to alternative fire safety strategies' Scottish Government (2010), which provides additional advice.", "Existing buildings - it may be appropriate to vary the guidance contained in this Handbook when assessing the guidance against the constraints in existing #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, especially those #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# which are listed in terms of their architectural or historic interest. In such cases, it would be appropriate to take into account a range of fire safety features, some of which are dealt with in this Handbook and some of which are not addressed in any detail. For more detailed information, guidance is contained in the `Guide for Practitioners 6 - Conversion of traditional buildings' (Historic Scotland).", "Fire engineering designs can be complex and many require extensive use of engineering judgement. The following documents are cited to ensure that the guidance given encompasses best practice worldwide:", [

      ], "The use of either document assumes that those carrying out or assessing a fire engineering approach have sufficient technical training, knowledge and experience to understand fully the risks involved.", "The objectives of any fire safety strategy should be established first and designers and verifiers should be aware of the importance of the design assumptions. For example, the strategy should include an assessment of the system reliability. This will help to ensure that the fire safety objectives have been met.", "Responsible person - it is important that owners/responsible person understand that the fire safety measures installed in a #DEFINED#building#TERM# need to be maintained and tested over the life time of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# so that they will operate effectively. BS 7974 and IFEG assume that all aspects of the fire engineering strategy are capable of being maintained and deployed over the lifetime of the #DEFINED#building#TERM#. If for example, alterations are found to be necessary due to changes to the #DEFINED#building#TERM# layout, the original strategy may need to be re-evaluated to ensure the fire safety provisions have not been compromised. For this reason, the fire strategy should preferably support any fire safety risk assessment required under Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005, as amended.", "Fire safety engineering involves the use of scientific based calculations and/or statistical information to demonstrate an adequate level of safety for a specific #DEFINED#building#TERM#, structure or installation. In this regard the fire safety strategy is based on performance rather than prescription. Therefore, fire safety engineering is about the need to identify the fire hazard, assess the fire risks, understand the consequences and to offer fire safety strategies and designs to show how the objectives have been met. The `tools' that support fire engineering can include calculation methods, which are used to demonstrate that under a worst reasonable case, tenable conditions are maintained during the evacuation period. For example, a smoke exhaust fan in a smoke reservoir within an atrium space fails to operate but the smoke layer height continues to be maintained by the activation of a stand-by fan.", "It is recognised that fire engineering is still a rapidly developing field and as such does not have the standardised codes for approaching and solving problems compared to other engineering disciplines. The documents identified above aim to provide a structured framework for assessing the interaction between, #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#, people and fire, and to facilitate innovation in design without compromising safety. They provide information on how to undertake a detailed analysis of specific aspects of fire safety engineering in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM#.", "In practice, both frameworks provide a flexible but formalised engineering approach to fire safety which can be applied to new or existing #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# to show that the functional standards have been met.", "BS 7974: 2019 Application of fire safety engineering principles to the design of buildings is supported by 7 published documents:", [

It is not sensible, therefore, to set down detailed guidance on how the fire safety analysis should be undertaken. Instead, it is the responsibility of the fire engineer to plan the analysis for the particular project, based on the decisions taken during the preparation of the fire engineering brief as discussed in Chapter 1.2.", "Places of lawful detention for example prisons, secure accommodation and mental health premises, present particular problems owing to the obvious difficulties of providing both the level of security required and effective means of evacuation in the event of fire. Due to the constraints this can place on the design it may be necessary to vary from the guidance contained in this section of the Technical Handbook.

Any necessary fire safety measures requiring #DEFINED#building#TERM##DEFINED#work#TERM# can then be included in the application.", "Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 (2005 Act), as amended introduced a fire safety regime which applies to #DEFINED#non-domestic buildings#TERM#.

The regime will also apply to #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# which are licensed as Houses in Multiple Occupation and to some #DEFINED#domestic buildings#TERM# where certain care services are provided. Those domestic premises covered by Part 3 of the 2005 Act are defined in section 78 of the Act.", "Persons with obligations under the Act are required to carry out a fire safety risk assessment which may require additional fire safety precautions to reduce the risk to life in case of fire.

The primary role of the suppression system may be for life safety or property protection.", "Life safety - automatic fire suppression systems react to heat therefore, the greatest protection is afforded to those occupants outwith the #DEFINED#room#TERM# of fire origin. Automatic suppression may provide some benefit to occupants in the #DEFINED#room#TERM# of fire origin where for example the fire growth is fast and the temperatures allow the sprinkler system to open early in the development phase of the fire. The spray pattern delivered from the heads should control fire spread, reduce temperatures and dilute the smoke. In some cases, the fire might be extinguished if the fire is not shielded from the sprinkler spray. A smaller fire means that the fire and rescue service will be able to bring the fire under control and extinguish it much more quickly.", "Property protection - concerns about fire have traditionally centred on life protection rather than asset protection. A primary objective of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# standards system however is to `further the achievement of sustainable development'. The sustainability of communities could be served by the protection against both deliberate and accidental fires in #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# such as schools that serve as social assets and components of the local economic network.

The ABI have produced guidance `ABI Study: Post Grenfell Research on Residential Sprinkler Systems' on issues to be considered to improve performance and in the procurement of residential and domestic sprinklers which is available on the ABI website.

The policy note may be downloaded from the resource section of Scottish Water's website. However, there is still a need for developers and designers to discuss project specific details with Scottish Water to determine what supply is likely to be available and what pressure can be expected. It is recognised that pressures may vary throughout the day and night, over the year and perhaps in future years. Therefore, it is imperative that the system is designed on the basis of what the minimum pressure and flow is likely to be. If there is any doubt, a tank and pump arrangement should be used.", "It is strongly recommended that developers should consult Scottish Water and the suppression system contractor early in the design process.

Whilst it could be argued that occupants of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# only need minutes to reach relative safety such as a #DEFINED#protected zone#TERM#, it should be remembered that the fire tests used to establish fire resistance duration in terms of time, do not replicate a real fire. In order to ensure the safe evacuation of the #DEFINED#building#TERM# occupants and to ensure that fire-fighters are not placed at undue risk, it is necessary to apply certain factors of safety to the fire resistance duration for structural and non-structural fire protection. For example, in a large intense fire, a British or European Standard 30 minute #DEFINED#fire door#TERM# may not last for more than the few minutes necessary to evacuate the #DEFINED#building#TERM#."],

The designer is free to choose materials or products which satisfy either the British Standard Tests or the Harmonised European Tests.", "Any test evidence or assessment used to substantiate the fire resistance rating of a wall, floor, ceiling, door or shutter should be carefully checked to ensure that it demonstrates compliance with appropriate fire tests and performance criteria contained in this handbook and is applicable to the complete installed assembly. For example, in the case of floors or ceilings small differences in details such as openings for lighting or ventilation can significantly affect the rating. Similarly, fire doors may also have small differences in detail such as glazing apertures, intumescent strips, door frames and ironmongery etc which may significantly affect the rating.", "British and European fire tests will co-exist in use until the British Standard classifications are withdrawn."],

Industries moved out or disappeared altogether leaving large, 'brownfield', gaps in our landscape. At the same time, changes in heating methods and the advent of the consumer society, have had a significant effect on the type and volume of refuse it has been necessary to dispose of to landfill. Inevitably, these changes have left behind a legacy of land contamination that in some cases, may be harmful. The Scottish Government encourages the use of previously developed land (brownfield) and local authorities may wish to promote brownfield land in preference to greenfield land.

The primary regulatory role for this rests with the local authorities. Local authorities and SEPA must establish public registers to record all prescribed regulatory action taken under Part IIA. The register will contain particulars relating to the remediation, as well as notifications of the identification of contaminated land. The registers will expand as new information is identified.", "Section 78A(2) of the Act (as amended) provides a specific definition of `contaminated land' for the purpose of the Act.

The key role of the planning system is to ensure that all the ground included within the planning application is suitable for the proposed future use. Conditions may be added to any permission given to ensure the required remediation takes place. Planning Advice Note (PAN) 33 `Development of Contaminated Land' explains further the role of planning and includes useful cross-references to other relevant publications and regimes.", "Harmful or dangerous substances include deposits of faecal or animal matter and any substance, or mixture of substances, which is, or could become, corrosive, explosive, flammable, radioactive or toxic or which produces, or could produce, any gas likely to have any such characteristic.", "Conversions - in the case of #DEFINED#conversions#TERM#, as specified in regulation 4, the #DEFINED#building#TERM# as #DEFINED#converted#TERM# shall meet the requirements of this standard in so far as is #DEFINED#reasonably practicable#TERM#, and in no case be worse than before the #DEFINED#conversion#TERM# (regulation 12, schedule 6)."],

Treatment may be the only option where the presence of structures or services prevents excavation. Treatment processes can be biological, chemical or physical and be undertaken either in-situ (contaminants are treated in the ground) or ex-situ (contaminated material is excavated and then treated before being returned). The processes convert the contaminant into a neutral form or render it harmless. There are also solidification and stabilisation processes that can `fix' contaminants in the soil so as to reduce the harm, and thermal processes that alter the contaminant by incineration or by volatilisation.

The trial hole should be left covered for a period of 48 hours before measuring any water table level. Subsoils that overlay bedrock allow water to move through the pore spaces between the grains of material of which they are composed. They are the first line of defence against pollution and act as a protecting filtering layer. Where these materials are unsaturated, pollution attenuation processes are often enhanced. Water flows through much of Scotland's bedrock via fissures. Attenuation of contaminants is limited in these cases. For safe and effective dispersal of the #DEFINED#wastewater#TERM#, the groundwater and bedrock should be at least 1m below the bottom of the distribution pipes. It should also be noted that it is the seasonally highest level of the water table that should be determined for the infiltration area.", "Third, to determine the type of infiltration system and the area of ground required, percolation tests should be carried out.

Fill the 300mm square section of the holes to a depth of at least 300mm with water and allow them to seep away overnight. It is important to saturate the soil surrounding the test holes to simulate day to day conditions in an operational drainage field. Next day, refill the test sections of the percolation holes with water to a depth of at least 300mm and observe the time (t) in seconds, for the water to seep away from 75% to 25% full level. Divide this time by 150mm. The answer gives the average time in seconds (Vp) required for the water to drop 1mm.

      "5.0.1 Background": ["Noise is unwanted sound. In order to limit the effects of unwanted sound the standards intend to improve the resistance of #DEFINED#building#TERM# elements to sound transmission. Research has presented clear evidence that noise can indirectly contribute to a range of health issues such as stress and anxiety.", "Inadequate sound insulation can impair health by allowing noise from other people to disrupt normal life. A number of people in #DEFINED#residential buildings#TERM# complain of noise made by others. The World Health Organisation has established a relationship between noise exposure and sleep disturbance however the next-day or long-term effects are still not clear."],
      "5.0.2 Aims": ["The purpose of the standards in Section 5 is to limit the transmission of sound to a level that will not threaten the health of occupants from sound transmission emanating from attached #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and a differently occupied part of the same #DEFINED#building#TERM#. They also cover sound from within the same #DEFINED#dwelling#TERM# if occupants are in #DEFINED#rooms#TERM# where they would expect to have some degree of peace and quiet.", "It is important to recognise that the standards will not guarantee freedom from unwanted sound transmission. The standards aim to limit the effects from sound created from normal domestic activities, but not from excessive noise from things such as power tools, audio systems inconsiderately played at high volume or even raised voices.", "The standards do not address environmental noise through the #DEFINED#building#TERM# facade from sources such as aircraft, trains, road traffic or industry. Other legislation covers these areas and further information may be obtained from Planning Advice Note PAN 1/2011 `Planning and Noise'."],

      "5.0.4 Explanation of terms": ["There are a number of terms used in this section some are included below, these and other useful terms are included in Annex A of the Example Constructions.", "Airborne sound is sound which is propagated from a noise source through the medium of air. Examples of these are speech and sound from a television.", "Airborne sound transmission is direct transmission of airborne sound through walls or floors. When sound energy is created in a #DEFINED#room#TERM#, for instance by conversation, some of the energy is reflected or absorbed by #DEFINED#room#TERM# surfaces but some may set up vibrations in the walls and floor. Depending on both the amount of energy and the type of #DEFINED#construction#TERM#, this can result in sound being transmitted to adjacent parts of the #DEFINED#building#TERM#.", "Direct transmission refers to the path of either airborne or impact sound through elements of #DEFINED#construction#TERM#.", "DnT,w is the weighted standardised level difference. A single-number quantity (weighted) which characterises the airborne sound insulation between two #DEFINED#rooms#TERM#, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1: 1997.", "Flanking transmission is airborne or impact transmission between #DEFINED#rooms#TERM# that is transmitted via flanking elements and/or flanking elements in conjunction with the main separating elements. An example of a flanking element is the inner leaf of an external wall that connects to the separating `core' of a wall or floor.", "Impact sound is sound which is propagated from a noise source through a direct medium. An example of this is footfall on a floor.", "Impact sound transmission is sound which is spread from an impact noise source in direct contact with a #DEFINED#building#TERM# element.", "L'nT,w is the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level. A single-number quantity (weighted) to characterise the impact sound insulation of floors, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-2: 1997.", "Rw is a single number quantity (weighted) which characterises the airborne sound insulation of a #DEFINED#building#TERM# element from measurements undertaken in a laboratory, in accordance with BS EN ISO 717-1: 1997."],
      "5.0.5 Reduction of sound transmission": ["The reduction of sound transmission from attached #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# and within #DEFINED#buildings#TERM# can be provided through different mechanisms which involve mass, isolation, absorption, resilience and stiffness (see annex A of the Example Constructions). Wall and floor #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# that provide a combination of such mechanisms generally provide better sound insulation.", "Good design incorporates at least 2 or more of the above mechanisms and can reduce a range of sound frequencies typically found in attached #DEFINED#residential buildings#TERM#.", "The effects these variables can have in predicting both sound transmission and insulation are as follows:", [
        ["#Li1_1#through a heavyweight wall or floor it is its mass per unit area. A reduction in sound transmission and increase in sound insulation are expected with increasing mass, as the heavier the wall or floor, the less it vibrates in response to sound waves and hence the less sound energy is radiated. For example, heavyweight #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# such as masonry cavity walls provide mass and isolation", "#Li1_2#through a lightweight wall or floor it is the use of cavities, structural coupling and absorption. A reduction in sound transmission and an increase in sound insulation are expected by the use of cavities with fewer and less stiff connections, while absorptive material hung in the wall cavity will absorb mid to high frequency sound energy. The formation of narrow cavities, such as dry linings on dabs, can also create an unwelcome `drum' effect at low frequencies and filling or lining them with absorbing material can help to reduce this. For example in lightweight #DEFINED#constructions#TERM# such as timber frame walls, the twin stud of the timber frame provides isolation, stiffness and absorption", "#Li1_3#resilience is often required for #DEFINED#separating floors#TERM# in #DEFINED#residential buildings#TERM# where there is direct vibration impact such as footfall noise. Resilience reduces the impact vibration by dynamic movement and also #DEFINED#converts#TERM# the energy into heat. Examples of resilient elements for floors include floating floor treatments such as battens and cradles, resilient bars and resilient floor coverings, other than carpet", "#Li1_4#mass and stiffness help to reduce significantly low frequency sound transmission whereas absorption and resilience predominantly reduce mid and high frequency sound transmission", "#Li1_5#isolation has the most influence over all frequencies of sound but can be limited by structural connections such as wall ties, straps and fixings that may bridge isolated leafs or elements."]
      ], "#Figure1#all_figures_dict_key_66#EndFigure1"],
      "5.0.6 Principles of airborne sound transmission": ["When sound waves strike a wall or floor, the pressure variations cause the #DEFINED#construction#TERM# to vibrate. A portion of the vibrational energy on the sound source side will be transferred through the wall or floor where it is radiated as airborne sound on the other side. There is a loss in sound transmission as the frequency of the incident sound (sound waves produced from striking against a wall or floor for example) increases. This also varies with the direction of the sound waves, and is usually assumed to be the average for all possible angles of incidence."],
      "5.0.7 Principles of impact sound transmission": ["Impact sound is sound that is spread from an impact or vibrational source in direct contact with a #DEFINED#building#TERM# element such as a floor. A structural vibration is transmitted from the point of impact through the structure causing vibration leading to the radiation of sound into an adjacent #DEFINED#room#TERM# below. In a #DEFINED#building#TERM# this is commonly caused by an object hitting the floor, from where the vibration is transferred into the structure. Usually the vibration path will lead to the ceiling and perimeter walls below. The amount of impact sound heard below will depend upon many factors including the force of the impact, the vibration transmission characteristics of the floor #DEFINED#construction#TERM# and the floor covering."],
      "5.0.8 Principles of flanking sound transmission": ["Flanking sound transmission occurs when there is an indirect path for sound to travel along elements adjacent to walls and floors. If the flanking #DEFINED#construction#TERM# and its connections with the separating structure are not correctly detailed, flanking transmission can equal, or even exceed, sound levels perceived as a result of direct transmission. Flanking transmission can occur, for instance, when a wall abuts the face of the inner leaf of an external cavity wall, and the walls are insufficiently tied or bonded together, thus allowing the noise to travel along the inner leaf."],
      "5.0.9 Relevant legislation": ["Listed below are some pieces of legislation and guidance that may be relevant and/or helpful to those using the guidance in this particular section.", "The Common Law of Nuisance recognises that an occupant has the right to the free and absolute use of the property, but only to the extent that such use does not discomfort or annoy a neighbour.", "Part IV of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 sets out a range of public nuisance offences.", "The Environmental Protection Act 1990 as it relates to noise, states that `any premises in such a state as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance ranks as a statutory nuisance'.", "The Human Rights Act 1998 (as it relates to noise) Article 8 guarantees the right to respect for private and family life.

      ], "Reference can be made to the application checklist (Table 1) below, which outlines the key questions in the assessment and verification of this process."],
      "6.D.2 Scope of improvements (types of installations which should be assessed)": ["Applicants should assess the potential for cost-effective improvement in the following areas, each of which is addressed in guidance on compliance to Standards 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 or 6.6 within the 2015 Non-domestic Technical Handbook:", [

The intent of this is to avoid the need to engage specialist contractors that are not already involved in a project. However, the applicant may broaden the scope of improvements considered if they choose to (for example, where the applicant considers such improvements to be more relevant to the building in question)."],
      "6.D.3 Extent of improvement required (assessing cost and practicality)": ["Improvement should be proportionate to the extent of proposed works. It is recommended that the cost of improvement works should amount to approximately 5% of the cost of proposed work. In this respect, assessment should be based upon cost of carrying out improvement works, exclude any design or consultancy fees. Where proposed improvements amount to less than this percentage, the applicant should, in scheduling the assessment process, provide evidence to support any reduced level of improvement.", "It is the intent that improvement works proposed should be cost-effective, with a short to medium payback period. Assessment need only consider improvements that, when combined, have a payback period of five years or less. The exception to this is the replacement of a boiler or chiller unit, where near the end of its useful life, as there will be additional cost benefit where replacing such equipment as part of more extensive works.", "The cost of any improvement works should be included in the estimated value of works used to determine the level of building warrant fee. The value of improvement works and proposed works should be identified separately to allow the proportion of improvement works to be verified.", "Work to improve fixed building services should be neither overly disruptive to the operation of the existing building nor require costly or extensive intervention to the building fabric. However, it is recognised that work chosen by the applicant (see clause 6.D.4) may be of such a nature. Where such enabling work is required, it should not be counted as part of the cost of improvement work."],
      "6.D.4 Assessment by applicant": ["To deliver improvements that are both cost-effective and relevant to the building being assessed, the types of improvement taken forward should be determined by the person responsible for the building (the relevant person/applicant) in consultation with any appointed agent or consultant. Recognising the complexity of the existing building and its systems, assessment should be carried out by persons with the necessary expertise to identify and assess cost-effective and energy efficient improvement.", "The intent of the Direction is to deliver cost-effective improvement to the performance of the existing building services. Applicants should be aware that it is therefore in their best interests for existing fixed building services to be examined and assessed, to enable the most effective and beneficial improvements to be identified for consideration.", "As noted in clause 6.D.2, whilst specific fixed building service issues are identified, the applicant may propose alternative improvements where they consider these more relevant to the building and can demonstrate that such improvement will deliver broadly equivalent benefit.", "Where an Energy Performance Certificate or similar assessment exists for the building, it would be good practice to check any recommendations on existing fixed building services amongst the cost-effective improvements already identified.", "For buildings with air conditioning systems, applicants should be aware of the need for inspection of systems over 12kW under regulation 17 of the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 and, where applicable, should consider instructing such an inspection where such systems are present. Information from this report will assist in assessing potential improvement to such systems under this Direction.", "To maximize benefit to the building, improvements should meet current performance levels recommended in the guidance to Standards 6.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 where this is reasonably practicable. Where not reasonably practicable, for technical reasons or for reasons of cost or level of disruption to the building, improvement should still be made to the extent that can be achieved. The applicant should take advice on the impact which a lower level of improvement may have on the cost effectiveness of such work and may choose to not make such improvements where payback periods are longer than five years. The case for this should be presented to the verifier."],
      "6.D.5 Review by verifier": ["The primary role of the verifier is to check that the process outlined above is observed and that proposed improvements to existing building services are of a scale appropriate to the proposed works or, if not, that substantiation for a reduced level of improvement is provided and is justifiable.", "Whilst the verifier may question the extent of proposals and request further evidence to support such enquiries, it is not expected that they should direct the types of improvement which are to be carried out for a particular case.", "On acceptance of proposals by the verifier, works arising under this Direction are subject to the same process as all other works requiring a building warrant, where the responsibility of the relevant person/applicant is to carry out works in accordance with the issued building warrant and the requirements of the building regulations in general. The verifier will make reasonable enquiry to establish this, prior to accepting a completion certificate."],
      "6.D.6 The role of the Local Authority": ["Due to the checking integral to the building warrant process, the local authority should generally have no direct role in this process other than as verifier. However, under section 25 of the Act, the local authority may serve a building regulations compliance notice on the building owner, if the improvement work is not carried out. Where the building owner fails to comply with the notice they are guilty of an offence.", "However, it should be noted that, if none of the proposed building warrant work is carried out on the building, no improvement work to existing fixed building services need be carried either."],
      "6.D.7 Supplementary information - Exclusion by compliance with previous standards": ["The performance of components in installations less than 13 years old (post 4 March 2002) need not be improved further where the minimum performance meets levels set within building regulations. The intent of this limitation is to avoid replacement of elements where installations are both recent and relatively energy efficient as this will generally be less cost-effective.", "Applicants should note that, as a wider range of building services issues are now addressed within building regulations (an example in 2010 being the introduction of a minimum efficiency for circulators and pumps), it will be necessary to measure performance of some elements against the current edition of the standards, where a level of performance is not identified in previous editions of the building regulations."],

The estimated value of the new work is pounds 50,000. Proposed works include power, lighting, heating and ventilations systems. The capacity of the existing boilers is sufficient to cater for the heating and hot water requirements of the extension.

      ], "The first option (installation of T5 retrofit kits) is above the 5% cost and the payback period (in isolation) is long. The third option (installation of variable speed drives), while within the identified 5% cost margin, has an unrealistically long payback period which would not make it a suitable choice for improvement.", "The remaining improvement item has a short payback period and amounts to less than 5% of the proposed value of works. The recommendations to improve the air conditioning systems are low cost but would contribute to assessment under the Direction.", "The building owners choose to implement the second option (replacing GLS with CFL) which has a short payback period and a high annual fuel cost saving, even though the initial cost is below the identified 5% works cost. They also identify improvement to the air conditioning system and the small cost this incurs. As works remain below the identified 5% works cost, evidence is provided to show that no other cost-effective improvements are applicable to the building.

In Scotland, sustainability is embedded into the building regulations for all new buildings, rather than reference being made to new buildings achieving levels within a voluntary system. Since 2005, progress has been made by strengthening the standards on, for example, energy efficiency and accessibility for all new buildings so they are comparable with the best in Europe.   ", "Whilst the standards within Sections 1 - 6 of the 2013 Technical Handbooks deliver a level of sustainability in a number of areas such as energy and surface water drainage, there is always the possibility of going beyond the minimum standard. Scottish Ministers consider that it is not practicable at this time to require every building to incorporate higher performance standards or further sustainability measures. However, developers may wish to gain recognition for building to higher standards. Additionally, organisations such as planning authorities or funding bodies may choose to make constructing to a higher level of sustainability a condition of approval or funding.", "Defining higher standards to measure sustainability will enable higher quality buildings to be created and for such benefits to be formally recognised. The continued development of Section 7 is the next step in encouraging the sustainable design and construction of all new buildings within a broader context of sustainable development. Further reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new buildings will also assist in meeting targets within the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009.

This section can respond in due course to the growing relative importance of embodied energy as the performance of new buildings improves further. At present these areas are outside the scope of this standard.
