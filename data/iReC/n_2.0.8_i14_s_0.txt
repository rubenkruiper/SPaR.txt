The Fire Safety and Places of Sports Act 1987 is amended by Article 13 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 (Consequential Modifications and Savings) Order 2006 so that a condition of a safety certificate for a regulated stand may not require a person to contravene Part 3 of the 2005 Act or regulations made under it and requires the local authority to amend such a certificate if it would have that effect.
