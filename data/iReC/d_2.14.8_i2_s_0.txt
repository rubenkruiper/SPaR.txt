An EAS system should not be used as mitigation for any defects in construction or as a compensatory measure for reduction in any other measures identified in this Technical Handbook as a means of compliance with the standards nor is it acceptable for an EAS to be regarded as a component of a fire engineering solution; in either case, this would imply fire and rescue service attendance was part of mitigating, or compensatory measures, or a component of a design solution, all of which would be unacceptable.
