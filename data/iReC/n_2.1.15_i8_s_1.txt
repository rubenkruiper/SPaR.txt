At the topmost storey of a building for example it is possible for the compartment wall to form a junction with a fire resisting ceiling (see clause 2.1.16), (including a suspended ceiling) or a localised capping system, provided the fire resistance duration is maintained and the junction between the wall and ceiling is fire stopped.
