Alternatively, check that upon the notional removal of each supporting column and each beam supporting one or more columns, or any nominal length of load-bearing wall (one at a time in each storey of the building) the building should remain stable and that the area of floor at any storey at risk of collapse should be not more than 15% of the floor area of that storey or 100m#SUP#2#SUP#, whichever is the less and does not extend further than the immediate adjacent storeys (see diagram below).
