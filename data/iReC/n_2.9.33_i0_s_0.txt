To reduce risk of smoke spread to more than 1 escape stair, corridor or lobby, a building with more than 1 escape route contained in a central core, should be planned so that the exits from the storey are remote from one another, and so that no 2 exits are approached from the same lift hall, common lobby or undivided corridor or linked by any of these other than through self-closing fire doors.
