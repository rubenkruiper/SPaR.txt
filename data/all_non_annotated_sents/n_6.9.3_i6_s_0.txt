Buildings over 250m2 frequently visited by the Public - where a new building, other than a public building, has a floor area of more than 250 square metres, members of the public have an express or implied licence to enter and it is so visited on at least a weekly basis, the EPC produced on completion must be displayed as for a public building (noted above).
