The basic principle is that junctions between compartment walls and compartment floors (including fire resisting ceilings, see clause 2.1.16) and other parts of the building should be designed and constructed to prevent a fire in one compartment flanking the wall, floor or ceiling and entering an other compartment at the junctions including any solum space or roof space (see annex 2.B for additional guidance on hospitals).
