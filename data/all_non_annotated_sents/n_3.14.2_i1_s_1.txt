By building with techniques designed to reduce air leakage there will need to be a reciprocal increase in the designed ventilation provision to make up for the lower levels of infiltrating air where the designer intends to use low fabric insulation rates of less than 5m#SUP#3#SUP#/h/m#SUP#2#SUP# in the energy assessment (see Section 6 Energy).
