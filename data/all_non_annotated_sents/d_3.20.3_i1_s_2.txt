Older appliances are likely to produce flue gas temperatures greater than 250 degrees C while modern boilers that bear the CE mark indicating compliance with the Boiler (Efficiency) Regulations 1993 will normally have flue gas temperatures less than 250 degrees C. Information for individual appliances should be sought from manufacturer's installation instructions, from the manufacturers themselves or from OFTEC.
