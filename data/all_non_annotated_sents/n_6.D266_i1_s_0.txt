Applicants should note that, as a wider range of building services issues are now addressed within building regulations (an example in 2010 being the introduction of a minimum efficiency for circulators and pumps), it will be necessary to measure performance of some elements against the current edition of the standards, where a level of performance is not identified in previous editions of the building regulations.
